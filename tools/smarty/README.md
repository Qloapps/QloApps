## Requirements

Smarty can be run with PHP 5.2 to PHP 7.4.

## Distribution repository

> Read the NEW_FEATURES and INHERITANCE_RELEASE_NOTES file for recent extensions to Smarty 3.1 functionality

Smarty versions 3.1.11 or later are now on github and can be installed with Composer.


The "smarty/smarty" package will start at libs/....   subfolder.

To get the latest stable version of Smarty 3.1 use:

```json
"require": {
    "smarty/smarty": "~3.1"
}
```

in your composer.json file.

To get the trunk version use:

```json
"require": {
    "smarty/smarty": "~3.1@dev"
}
```

For a specific version use something like:

```json
"require": {
    "smarty/smarty": "3.1.19"
}
```

PHPUnit test can be installed by corresponding composer entries like:

```json
"require": {
    "smarty/smarty-phpunit": "3.1.19"
}
```

Similar applies for the lexer/parser generator.

```json
"require": {
    "smarty/smarty-lexer": "3.1.19"
}
```

Or you could use:

```json
"require": {
    "smarty/smarty-dev": "3.1.19"
}
```

Which is a wrapper to install all 3 packages.

Composer can also be used for Smarty2 versions 2.6.24 to 2.6.30.
